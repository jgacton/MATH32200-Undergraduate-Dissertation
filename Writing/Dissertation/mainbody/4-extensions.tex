\section{Extension to Geometric Brownian Motion}
Consider now an alternative model for the midprice of the security for 
which we wish to make a market:
$$dS_u=\sigma S_udW_u$$
This defines the \textit{Geometric Brownian Motion} (without drift), and
is the canonical stochastic process used to model asset prices as in
contrast with the standard Brownian Motion, this process is valued in $\mathbb{R}^+$
