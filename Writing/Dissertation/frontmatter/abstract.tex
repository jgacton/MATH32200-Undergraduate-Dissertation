This paper presents a review of the complex mathematical theory that attempts to model the dynamics of an automated market-maker under inventory risk in financial markets. We outline begin by outlining financial markets, their participants and their microstructure, before discussing the requisite mathematical tools from stochastic analysis, stochastic calculus and stochastic control. Next, we investigate the seminal 2008 paper 'High-Frequency Trading in a Limit Order Book' by Avellaneda and Stoikov (2008), which formalises the approach of a market-maker trading through limit orders and utilises the dynamic programming principle to solve for the market-maker's optimal bid and ask quotes. We then present a recent extension to this model which extends the process governing the underlying stock price from a simple Brownian Motion to the more standard Geometric Brownian Motion. Finally, we implement the model in Python and present it's empirical results when back-tested on real order book data from a cryptocurrency exchange.
