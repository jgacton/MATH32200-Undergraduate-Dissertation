I want to thank my supervisor Professor Nick Whiteley for his constant encouragement, 
insight and patience whenever I had questions. I would also like to thank my personal tutor Dr Raphael Clifford, 
and the entire Schools of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol for putting together the 
BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science which I have had the privilege to study for the last three years.
\newline\newline
I would also like to express my gratitude to my mum, Ms Karin Acton, for her unconditional love and support over the last 21 years, 
and finally to my girlfriend Viktoria Leins who has made my time at Bristol more special than I could have ever imagined.
